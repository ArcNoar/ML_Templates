# ML_Templates
Initially, I did not plan to create a repository, because these are just code templates that I created (copied) in the process of learning,
but I thought that maybe someone will be useful even this source, 
in some files attached downloaded pages with explanations, 
in most files there is a source of video guidance on how to create it.
